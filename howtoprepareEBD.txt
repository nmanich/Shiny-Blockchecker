To prepare EBD eBird download file for use with Blockchecker Shiny app

(Iâ€™m writing these directions for me, where I intend to use postgres to export. If the file is small you can ignore this entirely, just prepare it in excel with the proper columns based on the example csv.)

1. Run R-script called convert_subid_to_URL, which loads in the EBD data and spits out a csv file with unique subids as clickable URLs.

2. Output csv from Step 1 can be merged into the postgres database to join it to the EBD.  Use sql_for_shiny.sql if you wish (or done with R or manually). Basically you are merging in the URL column we made, also merging in a column with block names, and exporting it out in the correct order (see test3.csv for the product you need if you want to do this manually).

3. Load in output from step 2 and convert all non-atlas portals to a single name (using Portal consolidation.R).

4. Use the output file from step 3 to run in the shiny app (called app2.R).
