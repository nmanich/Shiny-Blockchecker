To prepare EBD eBird download file for use with Blockchecker Shiny app

(Iâ€™m writing these directions for me, where I intend to use postgres to export. If the file is small you can ignore this entirely, just prepare it in excel with the proper columns based on the example csv.)

1. From postgres, export a csv with 2 columns: the sampling event identifier, and global unique identifier.

2. Run R-script called convert subid to URL.

3. Step 2 produces a csv that can be merged into the postgres database.

4. Merge in the names of the blocks to postgres.

5. Export the columns for shiny in the correct order from postgres.
