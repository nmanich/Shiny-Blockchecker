# Shiny-Blockchecker
Shiny App allowing querying of ebird atlas data for proofing purposes.

This allows you to use drop-downs to instantly filter atlas data. As written, you can pull up and filter records by block, species, or breeding category. 
You could swap out these fields and insert your own to filter by different categories in the EBD.

My eventual intent was to also use it to screen for out of portal and invalid data as a final check on atlas blocks.

The quick way to get it running is to run app2.R, pointing it to the file formatted like test3.csv. You can tell from the file names how polished a version this is, 
but I've got it running and working at the moment!
